    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Baked chicken wings are so easy to make, and they come out of the oven
      crispy and delicious. There's no need for flour
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply bake them in a 400°F oven for 40 minutes. And if you want them
      extra-crispy, leave them in a warm oven for 30-60 more minutes
    </p>
